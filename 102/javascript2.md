## JavaScript 2 
- Control Flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script
- Code runs from top to bottom (last will override the first)
- When you read a script it must be from start to finish, and you need to pay attention to program structure to see how execution is affected
### JavaScript Functions
- a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
- executed when invoked
- a JS function is defined with the function keyword, name and then parenthesis
- functions can contain the same rules as variables
- paramaters are in parenthesis 
- function arguments are  the values recieved by the function when invoked
- arguments in the function behave as local variables
- the function will execute when invoked by an event (button click), when js code calls it, or automatically
- return statement will cause the function to stop executing
- You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
- parenthesis invoke function
- variables become local when placed in a function
- local variables can only be accessed from within the function
- local variables can be assigned different variabled when used in diff functions
- = assigns a value to variable 
- (+) adds numbers
- (*) multiplies numbers
- a number and a srting added makes a string
