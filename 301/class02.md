# State and Props

- Render happens before componentDidMount
- Mounting the constructor is the first thing to happen in react
- the order that things happen is constructor, render, React Updates,componentDidMount,  componentWillUnmount
- you can pass arguments to functions into props
- Props you pass into a component and are handled outside of the component, and state is handled inside of a component
- you rerender when you change the state inside of a component
- You could store forms that take in information and change the webpage on submission, or some kind of counter in state

## Things I want to know more about

- I would like to know more about state vs. props. State is used for user input based data, while props is used for when the developer wants to change something?
