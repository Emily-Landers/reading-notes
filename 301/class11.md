| SQL    | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)    | primarily called as non-relational or distributed database      |
|  table based databases  | document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores       | 
|  predefined schema | dynamic schema for unstructured data |
|  vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
|  uses structured query language for defining and manipulating the data, | queries are focused on collection of documents |
|  examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL |  examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb |
|  good fit for the complex query intensive environment | databases are not good fit for complex queries |
|  not best fit for hierarchical data storage |better for the hierarchical data storage |
|   single server | multiple servers |
|  best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications | not comparable and stable enough in high load and for complex transactional applications |
|   Excellent support available | community support |
|   emphasizes on ACID properties ( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) | the Brewers CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance ) |
|  classified as either open-source or close-sourced from commercial vendors | classified on the basis of way of storing data as graph database |
