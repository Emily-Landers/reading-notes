# React and Forms

- An input form element whose value is controlled by React to create a form and control it is called a controlled component
- we should update the state as soon as they enter their responses because handleChange runs on every keystroke.
- How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field? 
```event.target.value```

- Ternary operatore use much less code than if/else statements
Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

```if(x===y){
console.log(true);
} else {
console.log(false);
}```

```x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);```

## Things I want to know more about
- using ternary operators with multiple conditions
