## How to Solve Programming Problems

- Take enough time to understand the problem before trying to solve it
- Keep solutions simple, don't try anything complex the first time solving it
- **Steps of Solving Problems**
    1. Read the problem completely twice.

    > - Read the problem through as many times as it takes to understand it. 
    > - Be able to explain it to other people.
    > - Work through any examples given to understand why each answer is correct.

    2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.

    > - “Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!”
    > - Solve any problem manually before automating the process, even if you are able to skip the manual steps.
    > - solve the problem with at least three different inputs to make sure you really understand your solution.
    > - Look for outliers to your solution, and account for them.
    > - Write out each step you go through in your head.

    3. Optimize the manual steps.

    > - Figure out all the ways in which a problem can be solved
    > - Identify points that can be optimized, simplified, or removed.

    4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

    > - Write out in simplest terms what your code should be doing

    5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

    > - Bring everything together into real code. 

    6. Optimize the real code.

    > - Not always necessary, but used to simplify code essentially.

- As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.
- Cut larger problems in half as a kind of divide and conquer tactic. (try to figure out what part of the problem if given to you would make it easier, and divide it from there).

## Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive

- Always be methodical in your time management planning.
- Busyness is indicative of poor planning and lack of discipline.
- You teach people how to treat you.
- Know how to prioritize.

## How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving

- Always have a framework and practice it.
- Devise a plan
- Break problems down into sub problems
- Approach bugs with curiosity rather than being irritated
- When stuck take a step back and and look at other perspectives 
- Utilize google

## 5 Whys Technique

- Counter measures over solutions
- Find out for yourself what is actually happening rather than what you think is happening

**Technique**

1. Assemble a team

2. Define the problem

3. Ask the first why

4. Ask "Why?" four more times

5. Know when to stop

6. Address the root cause

7. Monitor your measures

## The Event Loop

- JavaScript can do one thing at a time
- Single Threaded Runtime
- Network requests can block a stack
- Asynchronous requests can prevent blocking of stacks
- The event loop looks at the stack and the task queue and if the stack is empty will push the task queue items up to run it.
- Queue up events methodically

## The Super Mario Effect

- To learn more and find more success, don't view mistakes as failures. 
- Focus on the end goal, not the pitfalls
