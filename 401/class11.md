# Event Driven Applications

- Why is access control important? 
    - It controls who has what role/ permissions (read, write, edit, etc...)
- Describe an application that would need access control.
    - any application that contains sensitive data
- What is a role used for?
    - to give permissions
- Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
    - larger organizations have more flexibility to define who can control what 
    - Unlike Mandatory Access Control (MAC) where access to system resources is controlled by the operating system (under the control of a system administrator), Discretionary Access Control (DAC) allows each user to control access to their own data. DAC is typically the default access control mechanism for most desktop operating systems.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Authorization: the process of giving a user permissions
- Role Based Access Control: an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. 
- Capabilities:  a set of tasks that a system is potentially able to perform (acquired skills) at a certain performance level 

- Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
    - access control, RBAC, MAC
- Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
    - MAC, RBAC, DAC
- What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
    - RBAC
