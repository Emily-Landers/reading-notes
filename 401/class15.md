# Trees

- Node: A Tree node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes
- Root: The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- K: A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
- Left: A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- Right: A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
- Edge: The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf: A leaf is a node that does not have any children
- Height: The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

## Traversals

- Depth first vs. Breadth First
    - Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.
    - Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node

### Depth First Traversal methods

- Pre-order: root >> left >> right
- In-order: left >> root >> right
- Post-order: left >> right >> root

### Breadth First

 - Traditionally, breadth first traversal uses a queue (instead of the call stack via recursion) to traverse the width/breadth of the tree.
