# AWS: S3 and Lambda

- Describe “The Cloud”
    - a virtual server accessed over the internet
- What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
    - software that packages up code and its dependencies
- What is auto-scaling?
    - a cloud computing technique for dynamically allocating computational resources.
- What is bandwidth?
    - as the amount of data that can be transferred from one point to another within a network in a specific amount of time.
- How do cloud providers compute service costs?
    - by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud.

Document the following Vocabulary 

- Server Instances: collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance.

- Cloud Architecture: refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc.
- AWS: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.
