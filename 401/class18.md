# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

- Describe a use case for a serverless function.
    - The top use cases for serverless include workloads that are asynchronous, concurrent, infrequent, in sporadic demand, unpredictable variance in scaling requirements, stateless, ephemeral, and highly dynamic.
- If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?
    - Open the Functions page on the Lambda console.

    - Choose Create function.

    - Under Basic information, do the following:

    - For Function name, enter my-function.

    - For Runtime, confirm that Node.js 14.x is selected. Note that Lambda provides runtimes for .NET (PowerShell,C#) Go, Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby.

    - Choose Create function.
- Describe how a CDN works
    - a CDN is a network of servers linked together with the goal of delivering content as quickly, cheaply, reliably, and securely as possible. In order to improve speed and connectivity, a CDN will place servers at the exchange points between different networks. These Internet exchange points (IXPs) are the primary locations where different Internet providers connect in order to provide each other access to traffic originating on their different networks. By having a connection to these high speed and highly interconnected locations, a CDN provider is able to reduce costs and transit times in high speed data delivery.

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Serverless Functions: a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose.
- Cloud Storage: a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and operates data storage as a service.
- CDN: A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
