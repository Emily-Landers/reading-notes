# Reading: Bearer Authorization

- What can you do with an authorization code?
    - authorize a user into a security-protected space.
- What can you do with an access token?
    - make API requests on behalf of a user.
- Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
    - It enables apps to obtain limited access (scopes) to a user's data without giving away a user's password.

- Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Client ID: an identifier associated with an application that assists with client / server OAuth 2.0 authentication for client APIs.
- Client Secret:  a secret known only to your application and the authorization server. It protects your resources by only granting tokens to authorized requestors.
- Authentication Endpoint: a security mechanism designed to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to a given network, site or service.
- Access Token Endpoint: when apps make a request to get an access token for a user.
- API Endpoint: the point of entry in a communication channel when two systems are interacting. It refers to touchpoints of the communication between an API and a server. Basically a URL of a server or service.
- Authorization Code: a temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token. The code itself is obtained from the authorization server where the user gets a chance to see what the information the client is requesting, and approve or deny the request
- Access Token: an object encapsulating the security identity of a process or thread. A token is used to make security decisions and to store tamper-proof information about some system entity.
