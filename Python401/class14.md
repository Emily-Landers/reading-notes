# Matplotlib

- IPython is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs, access to shell commands, improved debugging and much more. 
- `matplotlib` is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats.
- `pyplot` provides a convenient interface to the `matplotlib` object-oriented plotting library. 
- While `matplotlib `defaults are rather good in most cases, you may want to modify some properties for specific cases.
- Spines are the lines connecting the axis tick marks and noting the boundaries of the data area. 
- A figure is the windows in the GUI that has "Figure #" as title. 
- As with other objects, you can set figure properties with the set_something methods.
- Axes are very similar to subplots but allow placement of plots at any location in the figure. So if we want to put a smaller plot inside a bigger one we do so with axes.
- Well formatted ticks are an important part of publishing-ready figures.
- The most easy way to make an animation in `matplotlib` is to declare a FuncAnimation object that specifies to` matplotlib` what is the figure to update, what is the update function and what is the delay between frames.
