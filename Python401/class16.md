# Serverless Computing

**Serverless is a cloud computing execution model that automatically provisions the computing resources required to run application code on demand, or in response to a specific event; automatically scales those resources up or down in response to increased or decreased demand, and automatically scales resources to zero when the application stops running.**

- Serverless offloads all management responsibility for backend cloud infrastructure and operations tasks
- With serverless they pay only for the resources required to run their applications, and only when those applications are running.
- The term 'serverless' describes the customer's experience with those servers: they are invisible to the customer
- Amazon Web Services introduced serverless in 2014 with AWS Lambda
- Serverless is a polyglot environment, enabling developers to code in any language or framework
