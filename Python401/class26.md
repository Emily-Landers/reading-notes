# Django

- Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram. 
- It is open source, meaning the code is available for free on Github and can be downloaded onto any developer’s computer and used alongside the official documentation.
- Deﬁne your data models entirely in Python. You get a rich, dynamic database-access API for free — but you can still write SQL if needed.
- To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a URLconf. Like a table of contents for your app, it contains a simple mapping between URL patterns and your views.
- Django provides a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data, and converting that data to native Python types.
- One of the most powerful parts of Django is its automatic admin interface. It reads metadata in your models to provide a powerful and production-ready interface that content producers can immediately use to start managing content on your site.
- Django provides multiple protections against:
    - Clickjacking
    - Cross-site scripting
    - Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
    - SQL injection
    - Remote code execution
