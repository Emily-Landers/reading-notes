# Django Models

- Django web applications access and manage data through Python objects referred to as models.
- Models define the structure of stored data, including the field types and possibly also their maximum size, default values, selection list options, help text for documentation, label text for forms, etc.
- Django handles all the dirty work of communicating with the database for you.
- The Django admin application can use your models to automatically build a site area that you can use to create, view, update, and delete records. 
- All you must do to add your models to the admin application is to register them.
- You can create a "superuser" account that has full access to the site and all needed permissions using `manage.py`.
