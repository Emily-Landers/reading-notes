# Django REST Framework & Docker

- Docker is a way to implement Linux containers
- Docker Compose is an additional tool that is automatically included with Mac and Windows downloads of Docker.
- Images and containers are the two fundamental concepts to grasp when you start with Docker. An image is a snapshot in time of what a project contains. A container is a running instance of the image.
- each image layer is immutable–unchanged–like a git commit.
- Order matters in Dockerfiles since they are executed from top-to-bottom.
- Django REST Framework works alongside the Django web framework to create web APIs.
- Django creates websites containing webpages, while Django REST Framework creates web APIs which are a collection of URL endpoints containing available HTTP verbs that return JSON.
