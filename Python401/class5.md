# Linked List Implementation

## Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

- Big O is a term used to describe the worst case of an algorithms efficiency of running time and memory space
- Running Time: The amount of time required for an algorithm to complete.
- Memory Space: The amount of memory resources required for an algorithm to complete.
- Input Size: Represented by the variable n, the total size of values used as parameters in an algorithm.
- Big Omega: The best case analysis of algorithm efficiency.
- Big Theta: The typical or random case used for analysis of algorithm efficiency.

## Linked Lists

- A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. 
- they are linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed.
- Linked lists donâ€™t need to take up a single block of memory; instead, the memory that they use can be scattered throughout.
- A node only knows about what data it contains, and who its neighbor is.
- a linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element.
- Each Node references the next Node in the link.
- There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly.
-  A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference
- A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
- Each node contains a property called Next
- Head is the first node in a linked list
- Current is a reference to the current node being looked at 
- When traversing a linked list, you are not able to use a foreach or for loop. 
- the Next property is what guides our traversal.
