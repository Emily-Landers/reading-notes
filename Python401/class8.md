# List Comprehensions

- List comprehension methods are an elegant way to create and manage lists. 
- In Python, list comprehensions are a more compact way of creating lists. 
- More flexible than for loops, list comprehension is usually faster than other methods.
- By taking advantage of list comprehensions, it’s possible to work on only part of a list.
- List comprehensions can make solving issues involving strings much easier using simplified expressions. 
- It’s also possible to read files in Python using list comprehension.
- Using list comprehension, we can iterate through the lines of text in the file and store their contents in a new list.
- Not only can we write our own functions with list comprehensions, but we can also add filters to better control the statements.
