**Day-to-Day Approach:**

**Conflict Plan:**

- Resolving Conflict: Addressing directly one-on-one is preferred.

- If someone is taking over the project: Bring it up during Scrum meeting, tell them what you are noticing

- If someone is not contributing enough: Ask them to step it up, ask if there is something they need to be successful

- If conflict needs escalating: Bring to group-level first, and if again that does not work, speak with JB about the issue.

**Communication Plan:**

- Hours of Availability: 9:00am - 6:00pm core hours
- Communication Platforms: Slack, Remo, Zoom, Google Hangouts
- Breaks: 12:00pm - 1:30pm lunch plus a 10 minute break on the hour
- Falling behind schedule: Mandatory overtime, or picking up others’ slack if possible and asking for help - utilize TA’s, other group members. Regroup and reevaluate scope if necessary (last resort). 
- After Hours/Weekend/Mics-Off Communication: Slack
- Voicing Concerns: Scrum meetings twice/day, remo working sessions
- Environment Safety: Accepting others for who they are, ensuring everyone has an opportunity to speak and feels heard/like a contributor
- During sprints: If working individually and a question comes up, DM one (1)  teammate instead of going on-mic or messaging the whole group. If working with a TA, move to another table before submitting the ticket.

Task Identification/Assignment/- Program Management: 
Trello program management tool, assign feature tasks to each person.
