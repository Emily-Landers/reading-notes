# Introduction
- HTML elements are added to the content of a page to describe its structure 
- ususally has opening and closing tags
- opening tags can carry attributes
- CSS uses rules to indicate how the contents of one or more elements should be displayed
- the selector indicated which elements the rule applies to 
- each declaration has a property and a value
##### Designing a script 
- decide the goal of your script first
- work out the individual tasks needed to achieve it next 
- break down each individual task into a sequence of tasks
- translate to code
#### How a Browser sees a webpage
- each page on a website is seen as a separate document
- without CSS default rendering is applied 
- the interpreter of the browser is what translates your JS instructions for the browser to use
- JS is translated line by line
- the browser recieves an HTML page> it creates a model of the page and stores it in memory> it shows the page on the screen using a rendering element
#### How to Use Objects and Methods 
- JS can use a calling method with an object, member operator, and the parameters
- ```document.write('good afternoon)```
##### JavaScript Runs where it is Found in the HTML
- when a browser comes across a ```<script>``` element it stops to load the script then checks to see if it needs to do anything else 
# HTML & CSS Introduction
- when you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world
- your browser will have to connect to the DNS server to find the location of the web server 
- you connect via an internet service provider (ISP)
- Your computer contacts a network of servers called domain name srevers or DNS
- they tell your computer the ip address associated with the requested domain name
#### Structure
- the opening ```<html>``` tag indicates that anything in-between it and the closing htms tag is html code
- the ```<body>``` tag is for anything meant to be shown on the main browser window
- words between ```<h1>``` tags is a main heading 
- a ```<p>``` tag is for paragraphs
- attributes tell us more about elements
- made up of a name and a value
- separated by an equals sign
- ```<p lang="en-us">paragraph in English</p>```
- the en-us is the value and the land is the name
#### Extra Markup
- There are some characters that are reserved for by html code (left and right angled brackets for example)
- escape characters if you want them to show up in your browser
#### HTML5 Layout
- new html5 elements indicate the purpos of different parts of a webpage and help to describe its structure
- new elements provide cleaner code
- old browsers dont understand html5 and need to be told what needs to be a block  level element
#### Process and Design
- Wireframes are a simple sketch of th key information a page will contain
- site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site
## The ABCs of Programming
- once you know the goal of your script you can work out the individual tasks needed to achieve it
- individual tasks may be broken down into a sequence of steps
