# Layout
 - ```<div>``` elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
-  Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
-  The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
-  Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
-  Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
-  Grids help create professional and flexible designs. X CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks. X You can include multiple CSS files in one 
- Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.
- Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.
- Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide (since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).
- Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases
or decreases
the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.
- Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the
size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
